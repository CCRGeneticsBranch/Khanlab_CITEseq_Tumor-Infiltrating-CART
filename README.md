Multimodal single-cell profiling reveals the enhanced antitumor activity of FGFR4/CD276 BiCisCAR T cells in rhabdomyosarcoma

CITEseqRscript is used to process CITE-seq data and explore the molecular basis of superior antitumor effect of FGFR4.28HTM.28z-CD276.8HTM.BBz BiCisCAR T cells compared with other FGFR4 or CD276 CARs infiltrating in RMS orthotopic tumor.
